# project
In this assignment, I learned how to add code to my repository, as well as make different folders inside my repository. I also learned how to upload files into them.I learned how to create issues that would show up on my project board, and learned that you can apply milestones to them. You can also automatically assign the issue to your project board which makes things a lot easier. when viewing your project after adding all of this stuff, it gives a clear view of all your files, and issues that need to be resolved. You are able to move these issues from three different columns making everything very easy to understand, whether its a todo thing, or already completed.
